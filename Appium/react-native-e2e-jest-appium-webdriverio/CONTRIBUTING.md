# Contributing

If you want to submit a PR for this repo, feel free to! It's just a sample project so the goal is just to keep it easy to play around with and explain the core goals.

Eslint and typing are not setup at this point in time because it's not really relevant.

As long as the E2E tests still pass, I'm happy with accepting PRs :)
